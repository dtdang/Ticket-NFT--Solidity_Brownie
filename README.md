# Ticket-NFT--Solidity_Brownie

This repo works with and uses NFT smart contracts in a python environment and React to create a web application. The goal of this project is to create free NFT tickets (not including gas fees) that users can redeem to an event with a limited amount of tickets per event. There is a limit of one ticket per person/wallet address.
